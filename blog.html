                    Debian and its derivatives, such as Ubuntu, are often considered the best choice for server environments. This is due to their stability, security, and extensive package management system. Debian's long release cycles ensure that software is well-tested before being deployed, making it a reliable choice for critical applications. Most repo's contain stable versions of software, which reduces the risk of bugs and compatibility issues, and there are may packages available for Debian, making it easy to find and install the software you need but still stable.

            <div class="blog-title">My GNOME Flashback experience</div>

                    I tried GNOME Flashback on my Debian system with a nostalgic wallpaper from Debian Etch.
                    The experience was surprisingly smooth and reminiscent of the classic GNOME 2 interface. The lightweight nature of Flashback made it feel smooth, even on older hardware. I appreciated the simplicity and ease of use, which allowed me to focus on my tasks without distractions. The panel customization options were a nice touch, letting me tailor the desktop to my preferences. Overall, it was a refreshing throwback to a simpler time in desktop environments.
                    I especially enjoyed the older vibe of the desktop and the old menu, I also tried Debian Lenny and Squeeze, which share the same interface as GNOME Flashback.
                    This is the reason why I like GNOME Flashback so much, it is a lightweight desktop environment that is very similar to the old GNOME 2 interface, that I loved.

                    Sooo. i have a new favorite desktop environment. MATE, MATE is a fork of Gnome2 and is continued to be developed.
                    MATE is lightweight and i love the oldschool vibe it has. I love the green color and customization options.
                    I managed to apply the Debian logo as menu bar button via Dconf Editor.
                    I also love the fact that MATE is still being developed and updated, unlike Gnome2 which is discontinued.
                    Overall, MATE is my new favorite desktop environment and i highly recommend it to anyone who loves the old Gnome2 vibe.
