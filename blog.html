                <h2 class="blog-title">My new favorite desktop environment</h2>
                <div class="blog-meta">By <b>Mealman1551</b> on <b>October 21

                <p>
                    MATE is my new favorite desktop environment. It's a fork of
                    GNOME2 and remains in active development.
                    MATE feels lightweight and has that wonderful old-school
                    vibe.
                    I even used Dconf Editor to set the Debian logo as my menu
                    button.
                    The fact that MATE is still actively maintained strikes the
                    perfect balance between nostalgia and functionality for me.

                <div class="blog-meta">By <b>Mealman1551</b> on <b>June 15

                <p>
                    I tried GNOME Flashback on my Debian system with a nostalgic
                    Etch wallpaper.
                    The experience was surprisingly smooth, reminiscent of the
                    classic GNOME 2 interface.
                    The lightweight design ensured fluid performance, even on
                    older hardware.
                    The simplicity and customizable panel make it a wonderfully
                    minimalist desktop environment.

                <h2 class="blog-title">Why Debian and Debian-based distros are
                    better for servers</h2>
                <div class="blog-meta">By <b>Mealman1551</b> on <b>May 27

                <p>
                    Debian and its derivatives, such as Ubuntu, are often
                    considered the best choice for servers.
                    Thanks to their stability, security, and extensive package
                    management, they are ideal for production environments.
                    The long release cycles ensure that software is thoroughly
                    tested, making Debian an extremely reliable choice.
                    Most repositories contain stable versions of software, which
                    minimizes bugs and compatibility issues.
