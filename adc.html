    <h1>ADC - ArchivedDataCodec</h1>
    <p>
      ADC (ArchivedDataCodec) is an open-source file extension and
      archiving/compression tool that uses Zlib for efficient compression and
      decompression of various file types. With a simple command-line interface,
      ADC supports both Windows and Linux, making it easy for users to archive
      and extract files.
    </p>
    <p>
      ADC Archiver uses an 8-byte header to identify and manage its archive
      format. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data, making it
      suitable for both personal and professional use.
