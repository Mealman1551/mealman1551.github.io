        <h1>ADC 1.0.0 End Of Life Notice</h1>
        <p>
            Please be advised that ADC (ArchivedDataCodec) version 1.0.0 will
            reach its End Of Life (EOL) on November 15, 2025.
            After this date, there will be no further updates, bug fixes, or
            support for this version.

            I recommend all users to upgrade to the latest version of ADC to
            ensure continued support and access to new features. The latest
            version is: 1.4.0 "Grand Canyon" LTS, and can be downloaded from the
