        <h1>What is ADCCoreUtil?</h1>
        <p>ADC Core Utility is a program that only extract .adc archives,
            without needing the full ADC Archiver software.

            This is useful for OEM manufacturers and users who only need to
            extract .adc files without the additional features of the full ADC
            Archiver software.

            One of the main advantages of using ADC Core Utility is its
            lightweight nature. It is a small program that does not require a
            lot of system resources, making it ideal for use on older or less
            powerful computers.

            For most users, the full ADC Archiver software is recommended, as it
            provides a more comprehensive set of features for managing .adc
            files. However, for those who only need to extract .adc files, ADC
            Core Utility is a great option.
